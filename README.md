# osu!js-scarlet
The 4th rewrite of osu!js, designed how we'd love osu! to look like & written entirely in Scratch.
<br>

# Disclaimer
Everything is still very much a WIP! Every aspect of the game is prone to change with time!

# Running/Editing osu!js-scarlet
While you can run scarlet in pretty much any Scratch mod that supports stage adjusting, we highly recommend using [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/editor?size=1920x1080&clones=Infinity&offscreen&limitless&fps=240&extension=https://mikedev101.github.io/turbo_networking.js).<br>
The URL linked here is already development ready to work on osu!js-scarlet

# Compiling osu!js-scarlet
For compiling the project into a runnable HTML, Standalone Executable etc. Use the packager specifically for TurboWarp projects; https://packager.turbowarp.org, with the following values:<br>

<b>Framerate:</b> 240 (Can however be set lower as scarlet uses Delta Timing.)<br>
<b>Interpolation:</b> Off<br>
<b>High Quality Pen:</b> On IF, your fork utilizes the "Pen" extension. Otherwise you can leave this as Off<br>
<b>Infinite Clones:</b> On<br>
<b>Remove Fencing:</b> On<br>
<b>Remove Miscellaneous Limits:</b> On<br>
<b>Custom Stage Size:</b> 1920x1080<br>
